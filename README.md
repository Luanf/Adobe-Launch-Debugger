## Purpose
This extension essentially has three parts accomplishing different facets of AA/Launch debugging:
* **Essential info Popup**. Make it easier and faster to get essential information about the Launch library and primitive highlighting of essential concerns:

* **Console logging**. Completely reimplement and improve what the AA Debugger extension does, fixing its bugs and ui, adding more configuration options:

* **Library Replacement**. Reimplement the Switch extension, essentially, but simpler and working. Simple logic to redirect the launch library fetch to a custom library. This is Planned only.
